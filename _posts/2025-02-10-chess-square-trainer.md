![Chess Square Trainer - a game to learn chess square notation](/images/chess/social_preview_image.jpg)

tl;dr I built a game that highlights squares and asks you to name them, fast.

Context: this was my "vibe coding" experiment before I knew this term. I used GPTo1 and Cursor+Claude 3.5.

👉 Play here: [https://chess-square-trainer.eddiesmo.com](https://chess-square-trainer.eddiesmo.com)

My high score is 21 :) 

### Why?

A basic chess skill is knowing square notation (e4, f6, etc) and I wanted to train it so I can easily follow chess videos and books.

But I only found apps that train you one way: they show you a square name and ask you to click it on the board.

I wanted to also train the other way - an app that highlights a square and asks you to name it. (Our brain learns best with both methods).

I didn't find it, so - I built it!

### 🎮 Features
- Clean interface with instant feedback, for people who enjoy blitz ;)
- Designed for desktop (keyboard!) but works great on mobile
- Train as White or Black
- Detailed feedback at the end of rounds
- Tracks your high scores

> Even more than seeing my score go up, it was really cool feeling my understanding grow so quickly! By just the 3rd game, I was able to intuit a few coordinates instead of stopping to count. By the 6th game, I was doing this more than half the time!
