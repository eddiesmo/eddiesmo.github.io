tl;dr I built a game that highlights squares and asks you to name them, fast.

Context: this was my "vibe coding" experiment before I knew this term. I used GPTo1 and Cursor+Claude 3.5.

ðŸ‘‰ Play here: [https://chess-square-trainer.eddiesmo.com](https://chess-square-trainer.eddiesmo.com)

### Why?

A basic chess skill is knowing square notation (e4, f6, etc) and I wanted to train it so I can easily follow chess videos and books.

But I only found apps that train you one way: they show you a square name and ask you to click it on the board.

I wanted to also train the other way - an app that highlights a square and asks you to name it. (Our brain learns best with both methods).

I didn't find it, so - I built it!

### ðŸŽ® Features
Clean interface with instant feedback, for people who enjoy blitz ;)

Designed for desktop (keyboard!) but works great on mobile

Train as White or Black

Detailed feedback at the end of rounds

Tracks your high scores

I've been playing 10 minutes a day for a few days and I'm already almost 2x better!

Sharing cause I'm proud of this little project and hope it helps others in the community :) Let me know if you have any feedback - I can probably add more features or polish on the weekend.

Enjoy!! ðŸ”¥

(My high score is 21)
