I live near Tel-Aviv, Israel and do technology and startups. Currently I lead Machine Vision Research at Alibaba Israel Machine Vision Lab, where we push the state of the art in computer vision and deep learning. See [linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eddiesmo) for more.

In my free time, Iâ€™m a [reader](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3595392-eddie), [photographer](https://www.flickr.com/photos/eddiesmo/albums/72157662830548055), [rationality](https://www.lesswrong.com/) geek and [trying to do good](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/).

I use this space to write about personal topics and passions. 
- I write about career related topics such as computer vision and machine learning on [Medium](https://medium.com/@eddiesmo). 
- I write about my travels in my [travel blog](https://eddiestravels.home.blog).
